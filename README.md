# PokeDex
A web application to search for pokemon dex entries for the first 151 pokemon. This project uses AJAX to access data from [PokeAPI](pokeapi.co). 

<b>Unfortunately, the PokeAPI is not compatible with Chrome and Codepen's recent change to HTTPS.</b> This project can be downloaded and viewed locally with the correct API data. Please note that this API's response time is rather slow and that it may take a while to load entries.
